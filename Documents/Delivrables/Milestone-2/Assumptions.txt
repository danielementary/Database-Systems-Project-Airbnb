Assumptions

1.	We assumed that all listingsâ€™ city corresponds to the filename and so put it for all listings accordingly to in which file they are.
2.	We put new ids for all listings and hosts to not have duplicates between cities.
3.	We removed reviewer if same id but not same name, we kept only one.
